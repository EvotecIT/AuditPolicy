## Supported Systems

This module was tested using Windows PowerShell 5.1 on:
- Windows 11
- Windows 2016
- Windows 2012 R2

It should work correctly on Windows 2019, Windows 2022, and Windows 10.
I belive it should work on Windows 2012 and earlier (assuming Windows PowerShell 5.1 will work) but that requires confirmation.
Registry values are different and I've not tested in on those systems.
As it's already not supported by Microsoft there's no need to investigate this.


### Ways to configure Auditing Policies on Windows Systems

There are three ways one can deal with setting up Auditing Policies in Windows systems. Those are:

- Group Policies (GPO)
- Local Group Policy Objects (using secpol.msc)
- Using AuditPol.exe

It's essential to understand the consequences of using all three methods. As Microsoft describes it in AuditPol and Local Security Policy, results may troubleshoot guide:

> AuditPol directly calls authorization APIs to implement the changes to the granular audit policy. Secpol.msc manipulates the Local Group Policy Object, which results in writing the changes to %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Microsoft\Windows NT\Audit\Audit.csv.

> The settings saved to the .csv file aren't applied directly to the system at the time of modification but are instead written to the file and read later by the client-side extension (CSE). At the next group policy refresh cycle, the CSE applies the modifications that are present in the .csv file.

It took me a while to understand what was happening and question the method I was using to set Auditing settings. Why is this important? Because if audit.csv exists with some settings that you do via Local Group Policy, whatever you set via auditpol.exe or my PowerShell Module will get scrapped.

Secpol.msc displays what is set in the local GPO. There's no "effective settings" view in secpol.msc that will merge granular AuditPol settings and what is defined locally as seen with secpol.msc.


### Installing PowerShell Module

```powershell
Install-Module -Name AuditPolicy -AllowClobber -Force
```

Force and AllowClobber aren't necessary but they do skip errors in case some appear.

### Updating PowerShell Module

```powershell
Update-Module -Name AuditPolicy
```

That's it. Whenever there's a new version you simply run the command and you can enjoy it. Remember, that you may need to close, reopen the PowerShell session if you have already used the module before updating it.

**The important thing** is if something works for you on production, keep using it till you test the new version on a test computer. I do changes that may not be big, but big enough that auto-update will break your code. For example, small rename to a parameter and your code stops working! Be responsible!

### Using PowerShell Module

#### Getting System Audit Policies

Getting system audit policies

```powershell
$AuditPolicies = Get-SystemAuditPolicy
$AuditPolicies | Format-Table
```

Getting system audit policies but split by category

```powershell
$AuditPolicies = Get-SystemAuditPolicy -Categories
$AuditPolicies | Format-Table
```

Getting single system audit policy

```powershell
Get-SystemAuditPolicy -Policy 'Application Group Management'
```

#### Setting System Audit Policies (via Local Security Policy)

**AuditPolicy** has 3 ways to modify System Audit Policies. One of the ways is doing it via **Local Security Policy**.
By using `UseLocalSecurityPolicy` switch we force AuditPolicy to use **Local Security Policy**.

```powershell
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -Policy 'Account Lockout' -Value SuccessAndFailure -UseLocalSecurityPolicy -WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -Policy 'Group Membership' -Value Failure -UseLocalSecurityPolicy -WhatIf
```

Please keep in mind that setting **AuditPolicy** via **Local Security Policy** has no immediate impact and requires GPO refresh (can be forced with `gpupdate /force`)

#### Setting System Audit Policies (via AuditPol)

Another option is to use `auditpol.exe`. In case `UseAuditPol` switch is used AuditPolicy will use `auditpol.exe` to set the Audit Policies.

```powershell
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -System 'Security State Change' -Value SuccessAndFailure -WhatIf:$WhatIf -UseAuditPol
```

#### Setting System Audit Policies (via standard means (registry))

Finally, the default option is to use the registry, which sets proper binary value with set options

```powershell
$WhatIf = $false
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -System 'Security State Change' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountLogon 'Other Account Logon Events' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountLogon 'Kerberos Authentication Service' -Value SuccessAndFailure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountLogon 'Credential Validation' -Value Success -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'Computer Account Management' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'Application Group Management' -Value Success -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'Distribution Group Management' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'Other Account Management Events' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'Security Group Management' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
Set-SystemAuditPolicy -AccountManagement 'User Account Management' -Value Failure -Verbose -WhatIf:$WhatIf
```

#### Backing up and restoring system audit policies

Sometimes before doing anything you may want to backup your policies

```powershell
Backup-SystemAuditPolicy | Out-File -FilePath $PSScriptRoot\Backups\AuditPolicy.json
```

To restore

```powershell
$FilePath = "$PSScriptRoot\Backups\AuditPolicy.json"

Restore-SystemAuditPolicy -FilePath $FilePath -Verbose -WhatIf
Restore-SystemAuditPolicy -FilePath $FilePath -Verbose -Policy 'Application Group Management' -WhatIf
```
#### Audit Policies Subcategories

Subcategories used within Audit.csv file to manage

| SubcategoryGUID                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| {0CCE9223-69AE-11D9-BED3-505054503030} | Identifies the Handle Manipulation audit subcategory. This subcategory audits events generated when a handle to an object is opened or closed.

Enabling Handle Manipulation causes implementation-specific security event data to be logged identifying the permissions that were used to grant or deny the access requested by the user; this is also known as "Reason for access". |
